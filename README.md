# sandwich_generator
This generator makes you the nicest sandwiches. There's nothing else here yet. Nothing but Sandwiches.
It's not too difficult. Just load everything and run the function.

To be fixed: The ingredients can have duplicates. This is because I use random.choice instead of random.sample or something of the sorts.
I wanted to keep the sentence nice and clean so uh yeah.

Whatever I'll fix it.
